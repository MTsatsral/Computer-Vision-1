## The course
In this repository you can find the code of our group for the labs of the Computer Vision 1 course. This course, taught at the University of Amsterdam for the master AI programme, consists of four computer labs and a final larger project. The first four computer labs cover topics such as photometric stereo algorithms, albedo and surface normals, Gaussian and Gabor filters, edge and corner detection, image alignment and stitching (see figure above).

The final project consists of two parts and two written reports. The first report performs a research into Bag-Of-Words image classification; in the second part a Two-Layer Neural Network and a Convolutional Neural Network are implemented to perform image classification. The reports can both be found above.

_**Note:**_ The data used to run the notebooks from the four labs is not uploaded to this GitHub repository, however the outputs of the notebooks are still visible. Contact didier.merk@gmail.com to receive any data used to run the notebooks.

## Computer Vision 2
During my master AI I have also followed the research-based course 'Computer Vision 2'. During this course my teammates and I attempt to improve an existing approach to the grounding of the generations of a text-to-image diffusion model. In this model an image and a segmentation mask for chosen target objects are simultaneously generated. We managed to improve the mIoU score by 4% using just a quarter of the original data. The paper we wrote for this research can also be found in this repository.
